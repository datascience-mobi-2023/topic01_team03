    "## 2. Description of the Datasets\n",
    "For this project the data consists of three different, publicly available datasets, each showing cell nucleii. All of the datasets consist of the original images, as well as the ground truth images, which can be used to evaluate the implemented segmentation algorithm. \n",
    "### 2.1. N2DH-GOWT1\n",
    "The first set of data contains 6 images of N2DH-GOWT1 mouse embryonic stem cells, which were stained by using a green flourescent protein targeted against the transcription facor Oct4. These images were captured using timelapse confocal microscopy and have a size of 1024x1024 pixels. The low contrast to the background and image noise are the main challlenges this datasets presents.\n",
    "### 2.2. N2DL-HeLa\n",
    "Dataset 2 therefore, contains 4 images of human N2DL-HeLa cells of cervical cancer with a size of 1100x700 pixels. The staining of these nuclei was also executed by using a green fluorescent protein, but targeted against H2b. The images were capured by an Olympus lx81 microscope used for live imaging of fluorescently labeled chromosomes. The main challenge this dataset presents is the low contrast.\n",
    "### 2.3. NIH3T3\n",
    "The last dataset consists of 15 images of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells which were visualized via Hoechst staining and captured with a fluorescence microscope. The size of these images is 1344x1024 pixels. A challenge this dataset embodies is the varying brigntness of the cell nucleii, as well as reflections, appearing as bright spots in the images.\n",

    "## 3. Methods\n",
    "To achieve an optimal image for applying the otsu thresholding algorithm we tested different preprocessing methods and compared how they performed when applied to each datatset by using the dice score as an evaluation method. \n",
    "### 3.1. Preprocessing\n",
    "#### 3.1.1. Mean filter\n",
    "The mean filter is used to blur an image in order to remove noise which is achieved by reducing the intensity variation between a pixel and its neighbors. At first the mean of the pixel values within a n x n kernel is determined and then the pixel intensity of the center element is replaced by the mean. However, this filter is strongly affected by outliers (pixels with a very unrepresentative value). A single outlier can significantly affect the mean value of all the pixels in its neighborhood. \n",
    "#### 3.1.2. Median filter\n",
    "Compared to the mean filter, the median filters evades the problem of outliers. It ranks the intensities of all pixels within a predefined nxn neighborhood for each pixel. The median of this series than replaces the intesity value of the central pixel. It is especially useful when trying to reduce impulsive noise (e.g. salt and pepper noise).\n",
    "#### 3.1.3. Gaussian filter\n",
    "The Gaussian filter is used to blur images and remove noise and detail. The Gaussian kernel has the shape of the 2-dimensional zero -mean Gaussian Function (bell-shape), which means pixels in the centre affect the new value of the central pixel more, than pixels further out. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "The intensity of the blurring effect depends on the  standard deviation $\\sigma$, a higher $\\sigma$ will lead to a stronger blurring effect.\n",
    "#### 3.1.4. Histogram stretching\n",
    "Histogram stretching descibes a linear scaling method to enlarge the contrast of an image.\n",
    "To perform histogram stretching, the intesity values of the pixels are stretched out, ranging from a desired minimum to a desired maximum (e.g. 0 to 255), this defines the lower and the upper limit *a* and *b*. Values below *a* are set to *a* and values above *b* are set to *b*. *c* and *d* represent the current minimum and maximum intensity values in the image. $P_{in}$ stands for the pixel intesity value before the stretching is performed.\n",

    "## 4. Image segmentation\n",
    "### 4.1 Otsu thresholding\n",
    "Defining a threshold can be very challenging if you do not have an image with a perfect bimodal distribution of pixel intensities. A bimodal distribution allows you to select your threshold easily by choosing the lowest point between the two peaks of your histogram for the threshold. Otsu´s method selects a threshold automatically by either minimizing the within class variance or maximizing the between class variance of the pixel intensities of your grayscale image no matter how many peaks your histogram has. The pixels are assigned new intensities according to the threshold: pixels with higher intensities than the threshold or the same intensity turn white, pixels with a lower intensity turn black. By performing this method your objects will be separated from the background of your image. \n",
    "Our algorithm computes the within-class variances by iterating over all possible thresholds. The within-class variance $\\sigma_w$ is calculated from the probability of class occurrence $\\omega$ and the class variance $\\sigma_i$. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "To achieve a binary and segmented image the pixels $g_T(x,y)$ are assigned new intensities depending on whether the pixels had a higher, lower, or the same intensity as the threshold $T$. Pixels with a higher or the same intensity are set 1, which is equivalent to the objects. Pixels with lower intensities are set 0, which is equivalent to the background.\n",

    "### 4.2 Two-Level Otsu Thresholding\n",
    "Otsu thresholding reaches its limits as soon as you have certain bright spots, reflections, or illumination in your image because these pixels tend to get assigned incorrectly. Fortunately, Otsu thresholding can be easily extended to multi-thresholding. By adding another threshold, you can solve that problem and separate bright spots from your objects. You get three different classes of pixels: bright spots, objects, and background. Just like the global Otsu thresholding the threshold is selected by minimizing the within-class variance. \n",
