## Functions
Here you can find all our functions. You can find a function for the preprocessing method: histogram stretching
You can also find functions in order to segmentate the image: '* local thresholding', '* two-level otsu', '* otsu thresholding'
To evaluate the efficiency of our segmentation results you can find a function for the dice score. 
In order to apply these functions on all our datasets easier and more clearly you can also find functions for the application.
