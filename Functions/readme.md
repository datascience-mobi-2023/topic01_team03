## Functions
Here you can find all our functions. You can find a function for the preprocessing method:
- histogram stretching<p>
You can also find functions in order to segmentate the image: 
- local thresholding 
- two-level otsu 
- otsu thresholding<p>
For each of these functions we implemented two versions: one for the application to png files (setting intensity values to 0 and 255) and one for the application to tif files (setting intensity values to 0 and 65535).<p>
To evaluate the efficiency of our segmentation results you can find a function for the dice score. 
In order to apply these functions on all our datasets easier and more clearly you can also find functions for the application.
